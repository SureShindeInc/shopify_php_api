To run the tests:

You can then access it by going to http://path/to/your/folder/shopify_php_api/test/index.php

You'll also need to set some values in lib/shopify_api_config.php if you wanna try *using* the API.

PHP_Shopify_API_Documentation.rtf has all the documentation on the API.

New PHP library for the Shopify API

The PHP library will allow developers who are more comfortable with PHP to create Shopify apps.

It has all the bells and whistles of its Ruby counterpart to help you create great applications for release in the Shopify App Store.

Authentication is easy to do. The API will generate all the necessary URLs your application needs to authenticate.

$api = new Session('mystore.myshopify.com', '', 'YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET');
header("Location: " $api->create_permission_url());

This will send the owner of 'mystore.myshopify.com' (usually you would prompt for this information) to the permission URL needed for authentication and installation of your app. The Shopify platform will then automatically redirect the user to your application's return URL with their shop, token and signature.

Now that your user has given your application permission to read and/or write, we can ask for the products in their store:

$storeProducts = $api->product->get();

foreach ($storeProducts as $product){
       echo $product['title'].'<br />';
}

This prints all products in the authenticated user's shop. You can also get a specific product by passing its product id to the product get() method.

$aProduct = $api->product->get(1234567);
echo $aProduct['title'];

To create a new product (if your application has write permissions), you can use the product create() method by passing fields you would like your new product to have.

$fields = array('title' => 'My New Product');
$api->product->create($fields);

To update a product (if your application has write permissions), you can use the product modify() method by passing the product id and the fields you would like to modify.

$fields = array('title' => 'My Updated Title');
$api->product->modify(1234567, $fields);

CHANGELOG

1.20100514.2

- Added a public metafield variable for each necessary class to CRUD metafields for that object.
- To get metafields for the whole shop you can use the metafield variable in the Session class. 
- Cleaned up some URLs passed to sendToAPI
- HTTP Code Error Handling is now down in the miniCURL class
- If there is an HTTP Code Error returned the API will die with the content from the Shopify API


1.20100514.1

Several changes made to the API.

- Removed all references of the FORMAT constant from URLs in sendToAPI calls and instead moved it inside the sendToAPI function.
- Removed SUCCESS and CREATED constants and instead sendToAPI will check for the right HTTP code based on the request header
- Test setup made easier
- Any get method with a cache would return an empty array if cache was true and the cache was empty. If the cache is empty and cache is true, the API will be queried.
