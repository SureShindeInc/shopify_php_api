To run the test:

First you need to enable Web Sharing in your System Preferences.

Once you have that going, drag and drop the shopify_php_api folder into

Users/YOUR_USERNAME_/Sites/

Open up shopify_php_api/test.php and update the USERNAME consant to your username.

You can then access it by going to http://localhost/~YOUR_USERNAME/shopify_php_api/test/index.php

You'll also need to set some values in lib/shopify_api_config.php if you wanna try *using* the API.

PHP_Shopify_API_Documentation.rtf has all the documentation on the API.


CHANGELOG

1.20100514.1

Several changes made to the API.

- Removed all references of the FORMAT constant from URLs in sendToAPI calls and instead moved it inside the sendToAPI function.
- Removed SUCCESS and CREATED constants and instead sendToAPI will check for the right HTTP code based on the request header
- Test setup made easier
- Any get method with a cache would return an empty array if cache was true and the cache was empty. If the cache is empty
and cache is true, the API will be queried.
