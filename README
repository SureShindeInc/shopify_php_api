To run the tests:

You can then access it by going to http://path/to/your/folder/shopify_php_api/test/index.php

You'll also need to set some values in lib/shopify_api_config.php if you wanna try *using* the API.

PHP_Shopify_API_Documentation.rtf has all the documentation on the API.

CHANGELOG

1.20100514.2

- Added a public metafield variable for each necessary class to CRUD metafields for that object.
- To get metafields for the whole shop you can use the metafield variable in the Session class. 
- Cleaned up some URLs passed to sendToAPI
- HTTP Code Error Handling is now down in the miniCURL class
- If there is an HTTP Code Error returned the API will die with the content from the Shopify API


1.20100514.1

Several changes made to the API.

- Removed all references of the FORMAT constant from URLs in sendToAPI calls and instead moved it inside the sendToAPI function.
- Removed SUCCESS and CREATED constants and instead sendToAPI will check for the right HTTP code based on the request header
- Test setup made easier
- Any get method with a cache would return an empty array if cache was true and the cache was empty. If the cache is empty and cache is true, the API will be queried.
