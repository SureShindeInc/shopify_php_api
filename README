To run the test:

First you need to enable Web Sharing in your System Preferences.

Once you have that going, drag and drop the shopify_php_api folder into

Users/YOUR_USERNAME_/Sites/

Open up shopify_php_api/test.php and update the USERNAME consant to your username.

You can then access it by going to http://localhost/~YOUR_USERNAME/shopify_php_api/test/index.php

You'll also need to set some values in lib/shopify_api_config.php if you wanna try *using* the API.
